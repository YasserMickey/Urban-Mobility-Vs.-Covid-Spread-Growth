This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and an informal paper submitted as part of a group project with two co-authors for our masters coursework:

**"Time correlation between the mobility restrictions implemented in UAE and their effect on the reduction of COVID-19 spread"**

## Contents

- `pdf file`: Informal paper detailing the study and results.

## Overview

Our essential research question is: **What is the time gap between the changes in urban mobility and its effects on the number of new COVID-19 cases in the UAE?** In other words, when does the effect of changes in mobility ‘kick in’, and does the time lag and effectiveness vary across different industries/businesses?

### Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis 1:** In the UAE, we estimate a time lag ranging between 9-15 days between mobility restrictions of up to 40% and their impact on COVID-19 cases.
- **Hypothesis 2:** We anticipate this time lag to vary across different categories in the UAE (retail, transport, workplace). This time lag is linked to the effectiveness of the restrictions taken to contain the spread of COVID-19.
